# css-animations


Create a new GitHub repository with a quick demo or example code (HTML/CSS) showing what you researched.
Not all things are easy to demonstrate but come up with something. A visual helps convey what it is you researched.

EXAMPLE:


Update the README.md file in your repository to include a short 2-3 sentence description of your topic & any links or references that were helpful in your research.

BRIEF:
Animations in CSS refer to transitions between style states within the CSS. They create actions within the webpage that don't require JavaScript and can run lighter than animations created in JavaScript, meaning they can run well even when the system is already doing a lot.

LINKS:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations - This link has everything to get started. I found it to be a super helpful and easy to understand overview of why it's beneficial to create animations in CSS and how to start.

https://www.creativebloq.com/inspiration/css-animation-examples - This link breaks down some animations that other companies are using, and I just found it really fascinating to look through and dissect.
